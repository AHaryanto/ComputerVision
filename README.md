# Traffic Counter

This is the result of my summer of research (2015) for the computer science department at
Berea College. The OpenCV library is used to detect moving objects in a video feed by background
subtraction and edge detection. 

The system counts counts the number of cars passing the road. The project was developed on
the original Raspberry Pi and therefore it needed to be fast to run. However, a faster device
is recommended.

## Blog Post

As part of the research, I wrote blog posts describing the progress made each week. It can be found
